### OAuth Tokens
*from [Access Tokens @ oauth.com](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/)*
``` text
Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user.
The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user’s data.

Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.
```

We use Personal Access Tokens for:
  - [access for products](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/about-apps#about-oauth-apps), including JetBrains apps, to our repositories, and
  - interaction with GitHub via automated scripts; see [Git automation with OAuth tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/github/extending-github/git-automation-with-oauth-tokens)

#### Personal Access Token Permissions
  - *recommended permissions based on JetBrains request, plus .gif at [create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)*
    - for JetBrains Project access: repo; admin:repo-hook; gist; read:org
    - for admin access: repo; admin:repo-hook; delete repo
    - for read access: repo; read:repo-hook

#### Create Personal Access Token
- GitHub: [create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token):
  - from [GitHub Developer Settings](#access-github-developer-settings): Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
    - set [Personal Access Token Permissions](#personal-access-token-permissions)
    - Generate New Token
